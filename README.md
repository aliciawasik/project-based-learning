# Introduction
Welcome to my Project-Based Learning page! Here, I document my hands-on learning journey through real-world projects. The goal is to deepen my understanding of new technologies and concepts by building actual projects, rather than just reading or watching tutorials.

# What is Project-Based Learning?
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an approach where learning is driven by building real-world projects. Instead of simply studying theory, I apply what I’ve learned by creating functional, tangible solutions. This approach helps me retain knowledge and develop practical skills.

# Why I Choose PBL
Project-Based Learning allows me to:

* Gain hands-on experience: I learn best by doing. Each project lets me apply theory to practical scenarios.

* Solve real-world problems: Projects push me to think critically, troubleshoot, and become more adaptive.

* Build my portfolio: Every project adds to my portfolio, showcasing my skills to potential employers or collaborators.

* Enhance retention: Learning by applying concepts to projects helps me retain knowledge better than traditional methods.

# Projects
Below are a few projects I've built through PBL. Each project represents an important milestone in my learning:

# Learning Philosophy
I believe in learning by doing. Each project challenges me to think critically, experiment, and iterate. It's not just about completing tasks—it's about developing a well-rounded skill set, learning from mistakes, and continuously improving.

# Future Projects
I'm excited to expand my learning into new areas such as:

* Machine Learning

* Mobile Apps

* Game Development
